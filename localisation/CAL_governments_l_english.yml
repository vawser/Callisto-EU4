 # Monarchy Reforms
 #---------------------------------------------
 cal_enforce_privileges_reform: "Strengthen Noble Privileges"
 cal_enforce_privileges_reform_desc: "The noble class has served our state well for generations and as it grows it is only fitting that we continue to confer great privileges to those families that have devoted themselves to our cause."
 
 cal_quash_noble_power_reform: "Curtail Noble Privileges"
 cal_quash_noble_power_reform_desc: "As the state grows it is becoming more and more apparent that the old noble families have too much influence and power. Their jealous concern for their old privileges is greatly hindering the growth of our government."
 
 cal_enforce_trader_privileges_reform: "Enforce Trader Privileges"
 cal_enforce_trader_privileges_reform: "By strengthening the ties between the state and successful merchant enterprises, we can increase our reach out into the world as well as the profit we bring home."

 cal_of_noble_bearing_reform: "Nobles of the Robe"
 cal_of_noble_bearing_reform_desc: "The noble families of the realm have sworn to provide not only council but also eternal loyalty to our monarch.

 cal_meritocratic_focus_reform: "Meritocratic Recruitment"
 cal_meritocratic_focus_reform_desc: "We cannot let old privileges govern who will get the privilege of serving our kingdom as it grows.

 cal_states_general_reform: "States General"
 cal_states_general_reform_desc: "By a Union of States with representatives in the States General we can more easily deal with the pro-federal movements in our nation while retaining our Monarchy.\n\nThrough elections and events, the §YStatists§! and §YMonarchists§! will vie for control over the nation. The effects of this reform and the frequency of elections depend on which faction is currently in power."

 cal_regional_representation_reform: "Regional Representation"
 cal_regional_representation_reform_desc: "The legislative assemblies of this land are an imperative part of our state and by strengthening their role we ensure efficiency as well as the legitimacy of our kingdom."

 cal_nepotism_reform: "Political Dynasties"
 cal_nepotism_reform_desc: "In this country a number of families have over time emerged as very willing to assume the responsibilities of state. So much so that it has become both expected of them to shoulder that responsibility, and expected of the state to offer it to their scions."
 
 cal_republicanism_reform: "Republicanism"
 cal_republicanism_reform_desc: "This Republic has made itself a guardian of Republican ideals, citizen power and everyone working together for the common good."

 cal_consolidation_of_power_reform: "Consolidation of Power"
 cal_consolidation_of_power_reform_desc: "The current terms for officials are too short to see through larger projects. This only feeds populism and leads to short-sighted policies.

 cal_lottery_reform: "Sortition"
 cal_lottery_reform_desc: "Elections by majority votes are prone to corruption or worse, populism. We shall employ a complex system of allotment to determine who should lead our Republic by selecting almost at random from among a pool of suitable candidates."

 cal_municipal_self_defense_reform_desc: "Only by relying on the military capabilities of our city state can we ensure our survival. We shall allocate more political power to the captains of the City Watch and ensure that they have all they need to provide for our defense."
 
 cal_broaden_executive_powers_reform: "Broaden Executive Powers"
 cal_broaden_executive_powers_reform_desc: "As the country grows so does the need to be able to act swiftly and efficiently. The only way to ensure this is by broadening the powers of the executive branch so that it has the tools it needs."
 
 cal_devolution_of_powers_reform: "Devolution of Powers"
 cal_devolution_of_powers_reform_desc: "No single person can rule a country as big and complex as ours.

 cal_citizenry_reform: "Citizenry"
 cal_citizenry_reform_desc: "A Republic relies on its citizens to function and so it is only right that each citizen in our state will have the power to vote for who will guide our country.

 cal_appointment_by_committee_reform: "Appointment by Committee"

 cal_loyal_nobility_reform: "Divine Nobility"
 cal_loyal_nobility_reform_desc: "There are those in our realm who are born with divine blood; chosen by the holy forces of this world to lead and rule.

 cal_religious_societies_reform: "Religious Society"
 cal_religious_societies_reform_desc: "While clan loyalties can take us far our expansion has made us the masters of more peoples than we once did. A strongly religious society can withstand expansion in both time and space more efficiently and will give us the cohesion we need."
 
 cal_lip_service_reform: "Lip Service"
 cal_lip_service_reform_desc: "While it is important to observe religious practices to maintain our legitimacy we should not get bogged down in the principles of righteous rule and morality. Pragmatism will take us longer and allow us to support a larger state and army."

 cal_articles_of_agreement_reform_desc: "The Articles of Agreement are the cornerstone of the social order on board a pirate ship.
