 THE_COLLAPSE_NAME: "The Rise of the Horde"
 THE_COLLAPSE_DESC: "The vast and bountiful human federation has spread its reach across the stars, pushing the frontier further than ever before. Callisto is one such frontier planet, and is a galactic melting pot of species. Recently, Callisto has become shrouded by a dense astroid fleet, rendering communication to the federation impossible. As the inhabitants of Callisto begin to realise their predicament, once friendly species turn on each other.""
