 ixa_guardian_of_tirisfal.1.title: "Mysteries of the Guardian"
 ixa_guardian_of_tirisfal.1.desc: "For years, Archmage Medivh, the guarding of Azeroth eluded us and kept himself away from poltics of the world. Secluded in his dark tower in Karazhan, he spent his days collecting ancient tomes from every corner of Azeroth and kept his secrets away even from us. As the biggest magicocracy in Azeroth, regaining control of The Guardian is vital for our future.\n\nFor this, some of the magi in court brought up the idea of sending one of the students to spy on Medivh as they learn from him. If this works, we may eventually gain a leverage against him. Edlers already have an amazing student in their mind, who fits perfectly for this job. Intelligent, silver-tongued and courageous, he will surely manage to keep sanity while in tower and persuade Medivh he can be trusted.\n\nHe is called Khadgar, we will contact him with your permission."
