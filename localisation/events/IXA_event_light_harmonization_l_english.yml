 ixa_harmonization.10.title: "Concept of Light"
 ixa_harmonization.10.desc: "The followers of the [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] faith have increasingly come to integrate our concepts and our rites in their daily life. A recent trend is to identify the concept of Light with their own beliefs. This interpretation is somewhat unorthodox to the scholar experts of our [Root.GovernmentName], but it has allowed the [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] faithful to integrate a number of Light concepts, rites, constants and classical teaching in their theology.\nThere is some debate in the halls of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] if this is the right and proper way on the path for the [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] adherents to elevate themselves."

If they are to ever elevate themselves from the past we must perhaps ensure that the classics and the proper rites are available for them to digest in their own language.\nThere are some scholars that have already begun to create such works. Should we encourage them to continue synthesizing their old religious concepts with the sublime principles of the Light?"
 ixa_harmonization.11.option.a: "Let them create their own version of proper form."
 ixa_harmonization.11.option.b: "This would be a travesty!"
 
 ixa_harmonization.12.title: "Faith of [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetName]"
 ixa_harmonization.12.desc: "Our trusted minister and confidant, [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetName] has worked closely with our [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] community in order to help them elevate their unknown culture. Surprised at [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetHerHis] findings, [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetSheHe] has started to adopt many [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] concepts after studying their science and literature intensely. Many worry that [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetSheHe] has gotten too taken in by [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] ways. Some even claim that our [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetTitle] has secretly converted, shaming [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetHerHis] ancestors and the [Root.GovernmentName] alike."
 ixa_harmonization.12.option.a: "Depose this [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetWomanMan]!"
 ixa_harmonization.12.option.b: "We have much to learn from the [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] people."
 
 ixa_harmonization.13.title: "Rights and Rite"
 ixa_harmonization.13.desc: "While they are part of our [Root.GovernmentName] some [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] traditions can be very hard to stomach. A civilized people is supposed to abide by what is right and logical according the Light's teachings, but these men and women have many customs in direct contradiction of such rules. Our officials in [harmonization_province.GetName] have been struggling with the locals who insist on their barbarous ways."
 ixa_harmonization.13.option.a: "Barbarians!"
 ixa_harmonization.13.option.b: "Such minor things do not concern us."
