 wwu_ancestral.1.title: "Passing of Great Leader"
 wwu_ancestral.1.desc: "$MONARCH$ is a great leader of our people and almost a legendary figure amongst the [Root.Culture.GetName] rulers. Sadly, recently [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] got terribly sick and shamans think [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] might've left only few days.\n\nIn ancestral tradition, we know spirits of great shamans do not leave this world after-life, and sometimes new leaders channel their spirits for guidance. Since [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] has proven [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] countless of times, we think $MONARCH$ deserves a special crypt only for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] for the eternal rest. On the other hand, certain statesmen in our council are against it. Some of them do not think $MONARCH$ deserves such treatment and doing so might offend other deceased [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]s."

 wwu_ancestral.2.desc: "During [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] meditation in a great tomb built in honour of a deceased legendary monarch, $MONARCH$ suddenly stumbled upon their lingering spirit.\n\n"I have been waiting for you" said the spirit in a thundering voice. $MONARCH$ bent to knee with respect as the spirit continued: "You may or may not see, but Our [Root.GovernmentName] is going through hard times. Dark times are ahead and I shall help you for the sake of our nation."\n\n $MONARCH$ gulped down, experiencing both fear and excitement at the same time. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] had to ask something, or pay his respects and leave. But asking too much might look bad."

But I was rewarded with a restless torment in this cursed tomb as return. Your ancestors disrespected my memory. And now, you shall pay for this\"\n\n $MONARCH$ gulped down, experiencing both fear and excitement at same time. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] had to do something: Run or Fight."
